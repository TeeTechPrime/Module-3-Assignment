          <h2>Chicken</h2>
          <p>
            Chicken breast is an excellent source of lean protein (protein
            without a lot of accompanying fat). That means most of the calories
            in chicken breast come from protein. People who eat enough protein
            are more likely to maintain muscle mass and preserve a healthy
            metabolism. Since chicken breasts are versatile and relatively
            inexpensive, it is smart to include chicken in a balanced, healthy
            eating plan. Chicken Breast Nutrition Facts One 3-ounce (85g)
            serving of boneless, skinless grilled chicken breast contains 128
            calories, 26 grams of protein, and 2.7 grams of fat with zero grams
            of carbohydrates.1 Note that many commercially packaged chicken
            breasts are much larger than 3 ounces. So if you eat a single
            breast, you’re probably eating more than a single serving.
            <br />
            Calories: 128 Fat: 2.7g Sodium: 44mg Carbohydrates: 0g Fiber: 0g
            Sugars: 0g Protein: 26g Carbs Chicken breasts contain no sugar or
            starch (unless prepared with breading or seasonings), so they have
            no carbohydrates. The estimated glycemic load of chicken breast is
            zero.
            <br />
            <br />
            Fats Skinless chicken breast contains a small amount of fat, fewer
            than 3 grams. It is mostly unsaturated fat (there is less than 1
            gram of saturated fat in a 3-ounce portion of skinless chicken
            breast). If you keep the skin on your chicken breast, the fat,
            calorie, and protein counts will all be higher. A 3-ounce (85g)
            serving of roasted, broiled, or baked chicken breast with skin on
            provides 166 calories, 6.6 grams fat, and 25 grams protein.2
            Preparing your chicken breasts also often adds fat. If you use olive
            oil in a pan, for example, the olive oil increases the amount of fat
            in your final prepared dish. Olive oil contains monounsaturated fat
            and polyunsaturated fat, both of which provide health benefits.
            <br />
            Protein Chicken breasts are a good source of lean protein. For
            people who eat meat, consuming chicken is a simple way to meet some
            of your body's protein needs without consuming a lot of fat.
            Depending on the cooking method you choose, chicken breasts are also
            naturally low in sodium. Vitamins and Minerals Chicken breast is a
            very good source of selenium, phosphorus, vitamin B6, and niacin.
            Selenium is important for thyroid function and making DNA.3 Niacin
            and B6 are both in the family of water-soluble B vitamins that play
            an essential role in cellular functioning.4 Calories A full 80% of
            the calories in chicken breast come from protein. The rest comes
            from fat, as chicken breast has no carbohydrates. There are 128
            calories in a single 3- ounce serving of skinless chicken breast.
            <br /><br />
            Health Benefits The low-fat protein in chicken breast can offer many
            significant advantages, making this food a helpful addition to many
            eating plans. Specifically, the nutrients in chicken breast can help
            with muscle mass, bone health, appetite control, and even mood and
            sleep.
            <br />
            Builds and Maintains Muscle Mass Protein helps your body maintain
            muscle mass and also helps build muscle in conjunction with a
            strength training program.5 Because chicken breast is high in
            protein, it is part of a diet that can help you build muscle mass.
            Research shows that losses in muscle mass and strength are directly
            associated with mortality rates in older people.6 So even if you
            aren't trying to bulk up your muscles, preventing muscle loss is
            important regardless of age. Strengthens Bone Scientists and doctors
            once believed that a diet high in animal protein could reduce bone
            density and increase the risk of broken bones. However, more recent
            research shows that protein works with calcium to help protect
            bones.7 It's crucial to consume enough protein to keep bones strong
            and healthy. Reduces Appetite Consuming protein helps you feel full,
            which can help reduce food cravings and prevent overeating. One
            small study of overweight men on reduced-calorie diets, for example,
            found that those who ate more protein showed "improved appetite
            control and satiety."8 The amount of protein in chicken breast makes
            it a good choice for you if you're hoping to boost your satisfaction
            with meals.

          <h2>Beef</h2>
          <p>
            Nutrition facts Beef is primarily composed of protein and varying
            amounts of fat. Here are the nutrition facts for a 3.5-ounce
            (100-gram) serving of broiled, ground beef with 10% fat content (2):
            <br />
            Calories: 217 Water: 61% Protein: 26.1 grams Carbs: 0 grams Sugar: 0
            grams Fiber: 0 grams Fat: 11.8 grams Protein
            <br />
            Meat — such as beef — is mainly composed of protein. The protein
            content of lean, cooked beef is about 26–27% (2). Animal protein is
            usually of high quality, containing all nine essential amino acids
            needed for the growth and maintenance of your body (3). As the
            building blocks of proteins, amino acids are very important from a
            health perspective. Their composition in proteins varies widely,
            depending on the dietary source. Meat is one of the most complete
            dietary sources of protein, its amino acid profile being almost
            identical to that of your own muscles. For this reason, eating meat
            — or other sources of animal protein — may be of particular benefit
            after surgery and for recovering athletes. In combination with
            strength exercise, it also helps maintain and build muscle mass (3).
            <br />
            Fat Beef contains varying amounts of fat — also called beef tallow.
            Apart from adding flavor, fat increases the calorie content of meat
            considerably. The amount of fat in beef depends on the level of
            trimming and the animal’s age, breed, gender, and feed. Processed
            meat products, such as sausages and salami, tend to be high in fat.
            Lean meat is generally about 5–10% fat (4).

            <br /><br />
            Beef is mainly composed of saturated and monounsaturated fat,
            present in approximately equal amounts. The major fatty acids are
            stearic acid, oleic acid, and palmitic acid (3). Food products from
            ruminant animals — such as cows and sheep — also harbor trans fats
            known as ruminant trans fats (5). Unlike their industrially-produced
            counterparts, naturally-occurring ruminant trans fats are not
            considered unhealthy. The most common is conjugated linoleic acid
            (CLA), which is found in beef, lamb, and dairy products (5, 6). CLA
            has been linked to various health benefits — including weight loss.
            Still, large doses in supplements may have harmful metabolic
            consequences (7, 8, 9, 10, 11).

            Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, often with some
            sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients, like
            seafood, often raw, and vegetables.

            <br /><br />
            Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grained white rice, though
            it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grained rice. It is very
            often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellow-tailed,
            salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Unlike popular knowledge, many
            types of sushi are vegetarian as well. Cucumber and carrot Maki is
            one of the famous vegetarian sushi. Sushi is commonly eaten with
            condiments. It is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy
            sauce. Another uncommon fact about sushi is that it is completely
            okay to eat it with your hands because that is how it was supposed
            to be eaten.

            <br />
            Around 1824 in the Edo period, Hanaya Yohei invented nigiri-sushi
            which is sushi made by placing seafood on hand-pressed vinegared
            rice. It was the fast-food of chonin class in the Edo period. Sushi
            undoubtedly is a beautiful looking dish. Traditionally, sushi is
            served on minimalist Japanese-style, geometric, mono- or duo-tone
            wood or lacquer plates, keeping in mind the aesthetic qualities of
            the cuisine. As expected, Japan consumes a lot of sushi but the
            level of this goes to an extent that there is high-quality
            store-bought ready to eat sushi platters in convenience stores.
